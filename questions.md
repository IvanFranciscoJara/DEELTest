5- Fragment is a way to encapsulate 2 HTML tags in one, without adding another HTML tag
...
return{

<h1>Hi</h1>
<p>My name is Ivan</p>
}  
 ...
This could break the app because react only can return one element

7- async await allows you to write less code, callback are a little bit faster

8- the new state and a callback

9- At the beginning of the component change "class" by "function"
Delete render method
Change "constructor" by "useState"

Delete all "this" keywords
Next steps depend of the component
